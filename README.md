👋 Hi, I’m Rebecca 


:woman_scientist:: I'm a Phd student in "Future earth, climate change and societal challenges" at University of Bologna. The objective of my PhD project is the exploitation of the LOFAR (Low Frequency ARray) radio telescope for studying, modelling and, possibly, forecasting of the genesis and propagation of the ionospheric perturbations induced by Space Weather and lithospheric-atmospheric events (earthquake, volcanic eruption, tsunami, storms). The scholarship is funded by Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (Upper Atmosphere and radiopropagation unit in Rome)

👩‍🎓: Master's degree in Physics of Data at University of Padua, Bachelor's degree in Physics at Universty of Modena and Reggio Emilia
